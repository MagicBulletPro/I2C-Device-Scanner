# I2C Device Scanner

A simple Arduino project to scan and identify I2C devices on the I2C bus. This project uses the Wire library to communicate with I2C devices and prints their addresses to the Serial Monitor.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega)
- I2C devices
- Arduino IDE

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MagicBulletPro/I2C-Device-Scanner.git
    ```
2. Open the `I2C-Device-Scanner.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

1. Connect your I2C devices to the Arduino.
2. Upload the `I2C-Device-Scanner.ino` sketch to your Arduino board.
3. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set the baud rate to 115200).
4. The Serial Monitor will display the addresses of any I2C devices connected to the bus.
